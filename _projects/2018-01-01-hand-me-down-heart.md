My first electrocardiogram forced me to confront the latent knowledge that heart disease runs in my family. Having lost my father a year earlier from complications due to heart disease, I felt as if the leads and and electrodes of the electrocardiograph enveloped and constricted me, forcing me to confront my genetic fate. This series of self-portraits, of delicate collodion emulsion on glass and aluminum, is a meditation on that fate and seeks to capture that moment of morbid epiphany and the feeling of absolute fragility which accompanied that realization.
