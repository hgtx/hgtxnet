Hugo Teixeira grew up in the Luso-American community in San Jose, California. After 14 years living abroad in France, Portugal, Western China, and Macau, he returned to the United States to complete an MFA in the Photography and Related Media at the Rochester Institute of Technology. His artwork is inspired by magical realist literature and research about migration, expatriatism, displacement, and identity. He adopts a hybrid production approach which combines vernacular fabrication skills alongside various contemporary and historical photographic techniques. The resulting sculptures and collages exploit the semantic properties of his photographs, found images, and materials to best express the complex narratives of migrants and their descendants. As an artist and teacher, Hugo has exhibited work in the United States, Portugal, and Macau.
